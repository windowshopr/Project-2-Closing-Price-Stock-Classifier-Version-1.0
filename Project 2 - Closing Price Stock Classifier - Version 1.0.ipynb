    "# Project 2 - Closing Price Stock Classifier - Version 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "    Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my second repository! This one is a new take on my first project, which tried to predict the closing price of a stock given today's opening price, historical data, and engineered features using an automated regression optimization tool, TPOT, to find the best regression pipeline for the dataset. That project can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/windowshopr/Project-1-Closing-Price-Stock-Regressor-Version-1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of that project, I noticed that the regressor was unable to predict the closing price very accurately because the stock I was predicting, CLVS, absolutely tanked in the last 90 days from running that model. So low that that price hadn't been seen before during the training process. I had this idea before, but now it seems even more relevant, what if instead of trying to predict the actual closing price, we just simply tried to predict a Buy or Sell signal for that day? Would it have a decent accuracy score using the exact same work as before with feature engineering, etc.? Let's find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "    DISCLAIMER: This project is merely a compilation of various Python and machine learning skills that I have picked up \n",
    "    over the past few months and years. This tool is not actually meant to be used for stock advisement, it is for academic\n",
    "    and future development purposes only.\n",
    "    \n",

I'll explain how to install them all at the bottom of the list. Now I can't speak for other versions, but you need to be running ... Python 3.6 on Windows 10 ..., as that's what I'm running on my machine. Here are the dependencies you'll need:\n",

Did you in fact close higher than the open? Do this for all the days in the test set and see if you would have made any money. Remember, the testing and training sets are shuffled, so if you wanted to get a timeline return of this model, you'd have to go back and withhold a \"prediction\" dataset before passing it to the train test split function.
